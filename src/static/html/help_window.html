                This tool aims to predict if a mass pathology is malignant or non malignant.
                In order to generate the predictions, you should have to introduce an excel file with the following fields:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>ID:</strong> Identification field for every region of interest. This field must be unique.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>FILE_PATH:</strong> Absolute file path of the image. Only dicom and pgm formats are available.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>X_CORD:</strong> X-axis coordinates for center of abnormality. Coordinate system origin is
                    the bottom-left corner.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Y_CORD:</strong> Y-axis coordinates for center of abnormality. Coordinate system origin is
                    the bottom-left corner.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>RAD:</strong> Approximate radious (in pixels) of a circle enclosing the abnormality.
                    Every radious lower than 15 pixels will be ommited.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Once the input excel has been selected, you must specify one folder in order to store application outputs.
                Generated outputs are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Excel File:</strong> File with benign-malign mass classification for every observation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Malignant File:</strong> Folder with malignant clasificated mass images in png format.
                    Every image has its regions of interest marked in red.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Benign File:</strong> Folder with benign clasificated mass images in png format.
                    Every image has its regions of interest marked in red.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Error log files:</strong> Text files generated during execution informing about any issue.
                </li>
            </ul>
